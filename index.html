        <p class="lead mb-4">I graduated in 2019 from Upland High School, immediately that summer I enrolled at Mount San Antonio College. There I majored in History and was apart of many support groups such as BSU, and other college prepared classes; networked with professor on campus and other ones. While attending I took classes ranging from hands on art, drawing, pottery, and multiple history courses; majority were presentation based, which gave me first hand experience in teaching to others and analyzing the work correctly. Furthermore, with these classes it taught me to value time management, team work, communication and so much more! I graduated from Mt. Sac in 2021 with an AA-History from there I transferred to UCR to major in Ethnic Studies. <br><br>

        While at UCR iâ€™ve taken courses that specifically focus on Native Ameircans, African American and Asian Americans; these are the three specific fields I choose. Learning multiple cultural backgrounds will help with my communication skills as I can find common grounds of stuff they may know just from a different cultural perspective. In addition to this, allows me to correctly educate those in history, ethnics and critical race theory! To combine my skills from both colleges, helped me better prepare for the volunteering I participate in at Title 7 San Bernardino County and Sycamore Elementary located in Upland, California. In the program I mentor students and help them with activities that may need to be down, or crafts that we will do as a group; itâ€™s an all Native based group. While the elementary is a more diverse group, where I would tutor, clean after activities, grade papers; student teacher. Currently I am still at UCR and will be applying to graduate school in the near future, my long term plans is to become a educator within the college system. Preferably at a junior college level as a I have first hand experience as I am a transfer student. Also, I could mentor and tutor those on how to be successful at a college level and possibly what steps would need to be completed to get into school! 
<br><br>
        For my choice of study for graduate school I am interested into why the colonization structure for multiple BIPOC communities were treated significantly the same. Is there a reason as to why they follow the same law structure? For example reservation, concentration camps, slavery and more are techinally the same thing, just structured differently for each group. My study would be to check or verify if its completely random or did someone give the greenlight and advice to conduct these take overs/assimulation in such a way. To get to graduate school though I have a few steps, first finding out the deadlines for the exams and comparing the scores at multiple schools. Secondly, is findning a copy of the GRE text and to study, find a support system and pass! I feel confident as the education and experience ive had prepared me not only for education/youth jobs but also to prepare for the next steps of my education.
